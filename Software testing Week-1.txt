 Ans. (a) True

4. Which of the following are practised in level 3 thinking during testing?

 a. Testing is a mental discipline, everyone in an organization strives to test thoroughly.
 b. Testing is done mainly by developers, to debug their code.
 c. Testing is done to identify failures and reduce risks.
 d. Testing is done to show absence of errors.
 Ans. (c) Testing is done to identify failures and reduce risks

5. Which of the following best defines usability testing?

 a. Testing done to ensure that the software looks nice.
 b. Testing done to ensure that the software is usable by all the users.
 c. Testing done to understand how users can use a software.
 d. Testing done to ensure that the user interface of the software is as specified in the requirements.
 Ans. (d) Testing done to ensure that the user interface of the software is as specified in the requirements

6. Which of the following is a list of white-box testing techniques?

 a. Unit testing, performance testing.
 b. Integration testing, stress testing.

7. As per the lectures, which of the following sentences best defines a test case?

 a. A test case contains only inputs to the software artifact.
 b. A test case contains inputs to the software artifact along with the expected outputs.
 c. A test case contains inputs to the software artifact and a decision on pass or fail.
 d. A test case contains inputs to the software artifact, which is run and the actual output is also recorded as a part of the test case.
 Ans. (b) A test case contains inputs to the software artifact along with the expected outputs

8. When do we say that a set of test cases T satisfies the test requirements TR for a coverage criterion C?
